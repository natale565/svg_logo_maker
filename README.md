# SVG Logo Maker

# Description

- This application was created to allow the user to create simple logos in a SVG file using a Node.js command-line application.

- The application uses inquirer to prompt the user within the command line with questions on how they would like their logo to look (what text they would like their logo to display (up to 3 characters in length), the color of the text, the shape of their logo (triangle, square, or circle) and the color of that shape.) Once the user answers all prompts, then an SVG file is written using their selections to generate a logo.
